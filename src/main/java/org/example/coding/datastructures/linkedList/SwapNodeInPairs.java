     * Swaps every two adjacent nodes in a singly linked list.
     * <p>
     * Given the head of a singly linked list, this method swaps every two adjacent nodes
     * and returns the new head of the modified list. Node values are not modifiedâ€”only
     * the node connections (pointers) are changed.
     * </p>
     *
     *
     * <p>
     * A dummy node is used to simplify edge cases, especially when swapping the first pair.
     * Pointers are moved in groups of two to perform in-place swaps.
     * </p>
     *
     * @implNote The method performs in-place swapping using constant extra space.
     * Only node pointers are changed, not the node values.
     * @timecomplexity O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the list.
     * Each node is visited once during the iteration.
     * @spacecomplexity O(1) - No additional space is used other than a few pointers.
