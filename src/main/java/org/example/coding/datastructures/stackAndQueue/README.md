# üìö Stack and Queue in Java

## Introduction

**Stack and Queue** are fundamental linear data structures used to manage data in specific orders.

- **Stack:** Follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first to be removed.
  Implemented as a generic `StackImpl<T>` using arrays, with overflow and underflow handling.
- **Queue:** Follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first to be removed.
  Implemented as a circular `QueueImpl<T>` using arrays for efficient space utilization.

## Intuition

### Stack

- **Idea:** A stack operates like a stack of plates‚Äîelements are added (pushed) and removed (popped) from the top. It
  supports
  LIFO operations, making it ideal for reversing, tracking state, or backtracking.
- **Why it Works:** The array-based implementation (StackImpl<T>) maintains a top pointer, enabling O(1) push and pop
  operations. Overflow (when the stack is full) and underflow (when the stack is empty) are handled with checks.
- **Key Insight:** The LIFO property is perfect for problems requiring nested or recursive logic, such as evaluating
  expressions or checking balanced parentheses.

### Queue

- **Idea:** A queue operates like a line of people‚Äîelements are added (enqueued) at the rear and removed (dequeued) from
  the
  front. The circular QueueImpl<T> reuses space by wrapping around the array.
- **Why it Works:** The circular array implementation optimizes space by reusing emptied slots, with front and rear
  pointers
  enabling O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations. Checks for full or empty states prevent errors.
- **Key Insight:** The FIFO property suits problems involving sequential processing, such as task scheduling or sliding
  window
  maximums.

## Use Cases

Stack and Queue are widely used in:

### Real-World Applications:

- Stack: Undo functionality in editors, function call stack in programming languages, or backtracking in algorithms.
- Queue: Task scheduling in operating systems, message queues in distributed systems, or print job queues.

### Algorithm Optimization:

- Stack: Used in DFS, monotonic stack problems, or conversion of expressions (e.g., infix to postfix).
- Queue: Used in BFS, sliding window techniques, or implementing stacks using queues.

## Complexity Analysis

Below is the complexity analysis for key operations in `StackImpl<T>` and `QueueImpl<T>`:

### üß± Stack (StackImpl)

- Generic `StackImpl<T>` using arrays
- Overflow & underflow handling
- Utility methods: `top()`, `peek()`, `isEmpty()`

- Time Complexity:

    - Push: O(1) average, O(n) if resizing is needed.
    - Pop: O(1).
    - Peek/Top: O(1).
    - isEmpty: O(1).

- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing n elements, plus O(n) if resizing doubles the array.

### üîÅ Queue (QueueImpl)

- Circular `QueueImpl<T>` with array backing
- Efficient `enqueue()` and `dequeue()`
- Size & capacity checks
- Time Complexity:
    - Enqueue: O(1) average, O(n) if resizing is needed.
    - Dequeue: O(1).
    - Front: O(1).
    - isEmpty/isFull: O(1).

- Space Complexity: O(n) for storing n elements, plus O(n) if resizing doubles the array.
