# HashMap and HashSet

## Introduction

**HashMap and HashSet** are fundamental data structures in **Javaâ€™s Collections Framework**, leveraging hashing to
provide
efficient key-based access and storage of unique elements, respectively.

- **HashMap:** A key-value pair data structure that maps unique keys to values, allowing fast retrieval, insertion, and
  deletion based on keys. It is implemented as an array of buckets, with collisions resolved via linked lists or
  balanced  trees (in Java 8+).

- **HashSet:** A collection of unique elements, internally backed by a HashMap where elements are keys and values are
  dummy  objects. It ensures no duplicates and provides fast lookup and modification.
