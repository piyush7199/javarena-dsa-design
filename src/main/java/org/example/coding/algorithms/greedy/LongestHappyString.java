    /**
     * Constructs the longest possible "happy" string using given counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
     *
     * <p>
     * A "happy string" is defined as a string where no three consecutive characters are the same.
     * Given counts of 'a', 'b', and 'c', we want to form the longest valid string
     * under this constraint.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Intuition:</b><br>
     * Always try to place the character with the highest remaining frequency
     * to maximize the length of the string. However, if placing that character
     * would result in three consecutive identical characters, we must instead
     * choose the next most frequent character. This greedy strategy ensures
     * the string is as long as possible while respecting the "no three in a row" rule.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Approach:</b><br>
     * 1. Use a max-heap (PriorityQueue) to always pick the character with the highest remaining frequency.<br>
     * 2. Poll the most frequent character:<br>
     * - If appending it would cause three consecutive same characters,
     * pick the second-most frequent character instead.<br>
     * - Append the chosen character to the result and decrement its frequency.<br>
     * 3. Reinsert characters back into the heap if they still have remaining frequency.<br>
     * 4. Repeat until the heap is empty or no valid move is possible.<br>
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Time Complexity:</b> O((a + b + c) log 3) â‰ˆ O(a + b + c)<br>
     * - Each character is pushed/popped from the heap at most once per occurrence.<br>
     * - Heap size is at most 3 (since we only have 'a', 'b', 'c').<br>
     * </p>
     *
     * <p><b>Space Complexity:</b> O(1)<br>
     * - Aside from the output StringBuilder, we only maintain a priority queue
     * of size at most 3 and a few helper variables.<br>
     * </p>
