/**
 * Intuition:
 * -----------
 * We are given several classes, each with a number of passing students (i)
 * and a total number of students (j). The pass ratio for a class is i/j.
 * <p>
 * When we add one more passing student, the new ratio becomes (i+1)/(j+1).
 * The important observation is that we should always assign an extra student
 * to the class where this operation yields the **largest gain**:
 * <p>
 * gain(i, j) = (i+1)/(j+1) - i/j
 * <p>
 * By repeatedly applying this greedy choice, we ensure that every student
 * contributes maximally to the overall average.
 * <p>
 * Approach:
 * -----------
 * 1. Use a max-heap (PriorityQueue) ordered by "gain" instead of current avg.
 * 2. For each class, compute its initial gain and push it into the heap.
 * 3. While we still have extra students:
 * - Pop the class with the maximum gain.
 * - Add one passing student to it (i++, j++).
 * - Push it back with its updated gain.
 * 4. Finally, compute the average ratio across all classes.
 * <p>
 * Time Complexity:
 * - Building the heap: O(n log n), where n = number of classes.
 * - For each extra student, we do one poll and one offer: O(extraStudents * log n).
 * - Final accumulation: O(n).
 * - Total: O((n + extraStudents) * log n).
 * <p>
 * Space Complexity:
 * - PriorityQueue holds all n classes â†’ O(n).
