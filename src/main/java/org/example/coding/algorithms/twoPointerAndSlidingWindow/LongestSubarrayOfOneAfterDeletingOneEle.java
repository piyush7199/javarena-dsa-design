    /**
     * Problem: Given a binary array `nums`, return the length of the longest subarray
     * of 1's after deleting exactly one element (which must be deleted).
     * <p>
     * Intuition:
     * - Since we must delete one element, the problem reduces to finding the longest subarray
     * of 1's allowing at most one 0 inside it.
     * - We use a sliding window (two pointers `l` and `r`) to maintain a valid window
     * where at most one 0 is included.
     * - If we encounter a second 0, we shrink the window from the left until we remove the first 0.
     * <p>
     * Approach:
     * - Maintain two pointers: `l` (left boundary) and `r` (right boundary).
     * - Use variable `d` to record the index of the last 0 in the current window.
     * - Expand `r` forward:
     * - If `nums[r]` is 1, simply continue expanding.
     * - If `nums[r]` is 0 and no zero has been used (`d == -1`), mark its position.
     * - If a second zero is encountered, update max length (excluding one zero),
     * then shrink window by moving `l` past the first zero (`d + 1`).
     * - Finally, compute the maximum subarray length by considering the last window.
     * <p>
     * Time Complexity: O(n)
     * - Each element is visited at most twice (once by `r`, once by `l`).
     * <p>
     * Space Complexity: O(1)
     * - Uses only a few integer variables, independent of input size.
