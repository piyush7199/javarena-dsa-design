# ðŸ’° Greedy Algorithms

## Introduction

**Greedy Algorithms** make locally optimal choices at each step to achieve a globally optimal solution. They are used
for optimization problems where a greedy choice property holds.

---

## Intuition

- **Idea:** At each step, choose the best option available without considering future consequences, assuming the greedy
  choice leads to an optimal solution.

- **Why it Works:** For problems with the greedy choice property (local optimum leads to global optimum) and optimal
  substructure, greedy algorithms are efficient and correct.

- **Example:** In the Activity Selection problem, selecting the activity that finishes earliest maximizes the number of
  non-conflicting activities.

---

## Use Cases

- **Real-World Applications:** Resource allocation, scheduling, and network routing (e.g., Huffman coding for
  compression).
- **Graph Algorithms:** Used in Kruskalâ€™s and Primâ€™s algorithms for minimum spanning trees.

---

## Complexity Analysis

- **General Complexity:** Varies by problem, but greedy algorithms are often `O(n log n)` due to sorting or priority
  queue usage.

- **Activity Selection:**
    - **Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`** for sorting activities by finish time, O(n) for selection.
    - **Space Complexity: `O(1)`** auxiliary space (excluding input).

- **Fractional Knapsack:**
    - **Time Complexity: `O(n log n)`** for sorting items by value/weight ratio.
    - **Space Complexity: `O(1)`** auxiliary space.

## Algorithm (Activity Selection)

**Intuition:** Sort activities by finish time and greedily select the first activity that doesnâ€™t conflict with the last
selected activity, maximizing the number of activities.

```
function activitySelection(activities):
    # Input: list of activities with start and finish times
    # Output: maximum set of non-conflicting activities
    Sort activities by finish time
    result = []
    lastFinish = -infinity
    for each activity in activities:
        if activity.start >= lastFinish:
            result.append(activity)
            lastFinish = activity.finish
    return result
```
