# High-Level Design (HLD) Section

## Overview

The High-Level Design (HLD) section of the **javarena-dsa-design** repository provides resources for learning system
design concepts and preparing for software engineering interviews. It complements the DSA and LLD sections by focusing
on designing scalable, reliable, and performant systems. Topics include database design, consistency models, isolation
levels, and more, with theory, practical examples, and interview-style problems.

## Purpose

This section is designed for:

- **Interview Preparation**: Master HLD concepts and solve common system design problems.
- **Learning**: Understand how to architect real-world systems.
- **Reference**: Use as a guide for system design challenges in projects or interviews.

## Structure

The HLD section is organized as follows:

- **concepts/**: Contains markdown files explaining core system design topics.
    - Examples: `database_design.md`, `consistency_models.md`, `isolation_levels.md`.
    - Each file covers definitions, key concepts, real-world examples, trade-offs, and interview tips.
- **questions/**: Contains topic-specific question files and a `solutions/` subdirectory.
    - **{topic}.md**: Lists interview-style questions (e.g., `url_shortener_questions.md`).
- **templates/**: Contains `HLD-Concepts-Template.md` for adding new concept files.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and navigation guide.

Example:

```
/hld
├── concepts
│   ├── database_design.md
│   ├── consistency_models.md
│   ├── isolation_levels.md
├── questions
│   ├── design_url_shortner.md
├── README.md
```

## How to Use

1. **Learn Concepts**: Start with `concepts/` files like `database_design.md` to understand key system design topics.
2. **Practice Problems And Solution**: Explore `questions/{topic}.md`.
3. **Visualize Designs**: Use embedded Mermaid diagrams or linked Draw.io visuals to understand architectures.
4. **Prepare for Interviews**: Follow the "Interview Guidance" sections in concept files to ace system design
   interviews.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to enhance this section! To contribute:

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-topic`).
2. Add a new topic in `concepts/` using the [HLD-Concepts-Template.md](templates/HLD-Concepts-Template.md).
3. Add related questions and solution in `questions/{topic}.md`.
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
   5Use GitHub Issues to suggest new topics or improvements.

## Getting Started

- Start with [Database Design](concepts/database_design.md) to learn about SQL/NoSQL, schemas, and scalability.
- Explore [Consistency Models](concepts/consistency_models.md) for distributed system trade-offs.
- Try sample problems in `questions/url_shortener_questions.md` to practice designing a URL shortener. (In Progress)

Happy designing!
