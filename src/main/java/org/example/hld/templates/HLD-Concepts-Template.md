# [Topic Name]

## Definition

[Define the topic clearly and concisely, explaining what it is and its role in system design.]

## Why It Matters

[Explain the importance of this topic in system design, real-world applications, and interviews.]

## Key Concepts

### 1. [Concept 1]

- **Definition**: [What is it?]
- **How It Works**: [How does it function in a system?]
- **Examples**: [Real-world or database examples, e.g., Redis, MySQL.]
- **Use Cases**: [Where is it applied?]
- **Trade-offs**:
    - **Pros**: [Benefits]
    - **Cons**: [Drawbacks]

### 2. [Concept 2]

- [Repeat structure as above]

### 3. [Concept 3]

- [Repeat structure as above]

## Real-World Examples

- [Example 1: System (e.g., Netflix) and how it uses this concept.]
- [Example 2: Another system or database.]

## Trade-offs

- [Summarize key trade-offs, e.g., performance vs. consistency, scalability vs. complexity.]

## Important Notes

- [Key takeaways or best practices, e.g., "Choose X for Y scenarios."]
- [Common pitfalls or interview tips, e.g., "Clarify requirements before selecting a solution."]

## Interview Guidance

### Common Interview Questions

1. [Question 1: e.g., "Explain how X works in a system."]
2. [Question 2: e.g., "Design a system using X."]
3. [Question 3: e.g., "What are the trade-offs of X vs. Y?"]

### Tips for Interviews

- **Clarify Requirements**: [Ask about specific needs, e.g., scalability vs. consistency.]
- **Use Examples**: [Reference real-world systems.]
- **Draw Diagrams**: [Use tools like Mermaid to illustrate designs.]
- **Discuss Trade-offs**: [Highlight pros/cons of your approach.]
- **Handle Follow-ups**: [Anticipate questions like “What if X fails?”]

## Sample Interview Problem: Design a [System] Using [Topic]

### Problem Statement

[Describe the system to design, e.g., "Design a scalable X system handling Y QPS."]

### Approach

- **Functional Requirements**: [What the system must do.]
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: [Scalability, latency, consistency needs.]
- **Capacity Estimation**:
    - Storage: [Estimate data size, e.g., "1M users × 1KB = 1GB."]
    - Throughput: [Estimate QPS, e.g., "10K read QPS."]
- **Solution Components**:
    - [Component 1, e.g., database choice and why.]
    - [Component 2, e.g., caching strategy.]

### Solution
- [Describe components, e.g., database, cache, load balancer.]
- **Trade-offs:** [Pros and cons of the design.]
- **Scalability:** [How to handle increased load.]
- **Architecture**:
    - [Include a Mermaid diagram if applicable]:
