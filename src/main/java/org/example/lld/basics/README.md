## üß± Introduction to Low-Level Design

### What is Low-Level Design?

**Low-Level Design (LLD)** details a system's components‚Äîclasses, objects, methods, and their interactions‚Äîto implement
a high-level design. It translates abstract requirements into code-ready designs, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### Why LLD Matters for Developers

LLD helps you:

- Break down complex systems into manageable components.
- Write code that‚Äôs easy to test, debug, and extend.
- Prepare for system design interviews with structured problem-solving.

---

## üß± Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

OOP models real-world entities as objects with properties (data) and behaviors (methods), forming the foundation of LLD.

### Core Concepts

OOP organizes code into reusable, modular units, mimicking real-world relationships.

### üîë Four Pillars of OOP

**1. Encapsulation**
‚Üí Hides internal details, exposing only what‚Äôs needed‚Äîlike a bank vault protecting its contents.

```java
class BankAccount {
    private double balance; // Hidden from outside

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        if (amount > 0) balance += amount;
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

**2. Abstraction**
‚Üí Shows essential details, hiding complexity‚Äîlike a car‚Äôs dashboard concealing engine mechanics.

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move(); // Hides implementation
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void move() {
        System.out.println("Car moves on four wheels");
    }
}
```

**3. Inheritance**
‚Üí Allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors (IS-A relationship).

```java
class Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Some sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void sound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

**4. Polymorphism**
‚Üí Enables one interface to represent multiple forms, like a remote controlling different devices.

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal animal = new Dog(); // Dog behaves as Animal
        animal.sound(); // Outputs: Bark (runtime polymorphism)
    }
}
```

### Code Examples

See above for practical implementations of each pillar.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Overusing Inheritance:** Leads to tight coupling; prefer composition.
- **Ignoring Encapsulation:** Exposing internals breaks abstraction.

## üìä UML Diagram Basics

**UML (Unified Modeling Language)** visualizes system designs, acting as blueprints for LLD.

### What is UML?

UML standardizes the representation of system components and interactions.

### Types of UML Diagrams

| UML Diagram          | Purpose                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| **Class Diagram**    | Shows classes, attributes, methods, and relationships |
| **Sequence Diagram** | Shows flow of messages between objects over time      |
| **Use Case Diagram** | Shows user interaction with system functionalities    |
| **Activity Diagram** | Shows flow of actions, decisions, and concurrency     |

### Example: Class Diagram

```
+---------------------+
|      User           |
+---------------------+
| - name: String      |
| - email: String     |
+---------------------+
| + login(): void     |
| + logout(): void    |
+---------------------+
```

- `+` means public, `-` means private.
- Use arrows for relationships (e.g., `‚Üí` for association, `‚óÑ|‚Äì` for inheritance).

## üîó Object Relationships in LLD

Understanding class interactions is key to cohesive system design.

### Overview of Relationships

Classes relate through various patterns, defining how they collaborate.

### Types of Relationships

| Type        | Meaning                     | Example             | Lifespan    | Code Tip                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| Association | General connection          | `Student ‚Üî Teacher` | Independent | Object as a field         |
| Dependency  | Temporary usage             | `Order ‚Üí Payment`   | Short       | Passed via method         |
| Aggregation | Whole-part (can live alone) | `Library has Books` | Independent | Has-a relationship        |
| Composition | Whole-part (dies together)  | `Human has Heart`   | Dependent   | Initialize in constructor |

### Code Examples: Relationships

#### Association

```java
class Student {
    String name;
}

class Course {
    Student student; // Course has a Student
}
```

### üß© Dependency (uses)

```java
class OrderService {
    void placeOrder(Payment payment) {
        payment.pay(); // Temporary use of Payment
    }
}
```

### ‚ö™ Aggregation (whole-part, weak)

```java
class Book {
    String title;
}

class Library {
    List<Book> books; // Books can exist without Library
}
```

### ‚ö´ Composition (whole-part, strong)

```java
class Heart {
    void beat() { /* ... */ }
}

class Human {
    private final Heart heart = new Heart(); // Heart dies with Human
}
```

## üß† SOLID Principles

**SOLID principles** ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

### Introduction to SOLID

SOLID is a set of five guidelines for robust OOP design.

| Principle                     | Meaning                                     | Simple Explanation                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **S** ‚Äì Single Responsibility | One class, one job                          | A class shouldn‚Äôt handle unrelated tasks (e.g., User vs. Emailer). |
| **O** ‚Äì Open/Closed           | Open to extend, closed to modify            | Extend behavior via interfaces, don‚Äôt modify code.                 |
| **L** ‚Äì Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes act like their parent              | Subclasses should be swappable without breaking functionality.     |
| **I** ‚Äì Interface Segregation | Don‚Äôt force unused methods                  | Use small, specific interfaces, not bloated ones.                  |
| **D** ‚Äì Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions, not implementations | Use interfaces to decouple high-level and low-level modules.       |

### Practical Applications

- Single Responsibility: Split User from email-sending logic.
- Open/Closed: Use a Payment interface to add new payment methods.

## üèóÔ∏è Design Patterns Overview

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common design problems.

### What are Design Patterns?

Patterns provide tested approaches to structure code effectively.

### Categories of Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

Control object creation to reduce complexity.

| Pattern                                                 | Purpose                                |
|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| [Singleton](../patterns/creational/singleton/README.md) | Ensures only one instance exists       |
| Factory                                                 | Creates objects without exposing logic |
| Builder                                                 | Builds complex objects step-by-step    |
| Prototype                                               | Clone existing object                  |
| Abstract Factory                                        | Create families of related objects     |

### Structural Patterns

Organize classes and objects into larger structures.

| Pattern                                                 | Purpose                                  |
|---------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Adapter                                                 | Converts one interface into another      |
| [Decorator](../patterns/structural/decorator/README.md) | Add functionality dynamically            |
| Composite                                               | Tree structure of objects                |
| Proxy                                                   | Stand-in for another object              |
| Bridge                                                  | Decouple abstraction from implementation |
| Flyweight                                               | Share objects to save memory             |
| Facade                                                  | Simplified interface to a complex system |

### Behavioral Patterns

Handle object communication and responsibilities.

| Pattern                 | Purpose                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Strategy                | Switch behavior at runtime                |
| Observer                | Notify dependents on change               |
| Command                 | Encapsulate a request as an object        |
| State                   | Object changes behavior by internal state |
| Template                | Define algorithm skeleton                 |
| Chain of Responsibility | Pass request along a chain                |
| Mediator                | Central controller for interactions       |
| Memento                 | Save/restore object state                 |
| Visitor                 | Add operations without modifying classes  |
| Interpreter             | Interpret expressions based on grammar    |

### When to Use Design Patterns

- Singleton: Single database connection.
- Factory: Create objects based on user input.
- Observer: Event-driven systems (e.g., UI updates).
