- Include links to LeetCode/GFG problems and proper folder placement.
- Update the respective README (topic-wise) and/or company-wise `.md` files.

### 🏢 Company-wise Problems

- If you're solving problems asked in companies (Amazon, Google, etc.):
    - Add the solution file to the appropriate DSA topic folder.
    - Make sure to update the respective company `.md` file (or let the script do it).

## ✅ Code Guidelines

- Use proper Java conventions (camelCase, PascalCase for classes).

- Keep each solution or design in its own `.java` file.
- Add minimal but clear comments to explain your logic.
